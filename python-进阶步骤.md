# 7 Python for Everyday Life (Video) 
Claudio Sparpaglione 
ISBN 13: 9781788621953 Packt Course Length: 14 hours 22 minutes (APRIL 2018) 
Video Overview: 
Make your day and master the Python: a powerful and versatile language and ecosystem that can help you save time and money. This video course is about leveraging the Python programming language and its thriving ecosystem to save yourself time and money when doing common routine tasks. Nobody wants to do boring and time-consuming tasks: days have 24 hours and you should squeeze out the most of this time for yourself - automating the boring tasks gives you back time to focus on what you really like to do. Moreover, this is also the chance for you to learn a great general-purpose language such as Python, with which you can build very cool applications both at work and in your spare time. 
The course is structured as an incremental learning path: you will start with a deep-dive into Python software development basics, then move on to write scripts to automate file system operations and file contents processing on your local host, then you will learn how to interact with web-based services such as websites and APIs in order to robotize the cool things that we do everyday - such as tweeting, posting to social networks, reading RSS feeds, etc. - moreover you will practice how to set up a web-based services yourself in the form of web applications and in the end you will learn how to analyze and visualize datasets in order to extract knowledge. By the end of this course you will have learned how to proficiently write structured Python code in a wide range of applications – from one-liner scripts to complex web applications – aiming at the automation of lots of common everyday life tasks.

Learn everything you need to know about Machine learning with Tensorflow and Scikit-Learn 
Machine Learning is one of the most transformative and impactful technologies of our time. From advertising to healthcare, to self-driving cars, it is hard to find an industry that has not been or is not being revolutionized by machine learning. Using the two most popular frameworks, Tensor Flow and Scikit-Learn, this course will show you insightful tools and techniques for building intelligent systems. Using Scikit-learn you will create a Machine Learning project from scratch, and, use the Tensor Flow library to build and train professional neural networks. 
We will use these frameworks to build a variety of applications for problems such as ad ranking and sentiment classification. The course will then take you through the methods for unsupervised learning and what to do when you have limited or no labels for your data. We use the techniques we have learned, along with some new ones, to build a sentiment classifier, an autocomplete keyboard and a topic discoverer.
