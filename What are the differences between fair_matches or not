How do you have two kids cut a cookie in half fairly? You tell one kid to cut it in half, then you let the _other_ kid pick which half they want. If the cutter makes the pieces different sizes, the chooser will pick the bigger piece and the cutter gets a smaller one. The optimal choice is to cut it exactly in half. 

Fair matches attempt to mitigate advantage caused by starting position.

Suppose Random plays Greedy in 5 matches. Each player will play 5 as p1 and 5 as p2. Random gets lucky and picks a starting position that is guaranteed to win in all matches as p1, and Greedy gets unlucky and picks losing starting positions in all 5 of his matches as p1. So we conclude that Random wins 100% against Greedy. 

If we run “fair” matches then we play those exact same games, but then we _replay_ them where the agents switch openings. For example if we were using tic tac toe and Random as p1 played O in middle while Greedy as p2 responded with X in NW corner. Then we would add a fair match where Greedy plays as P1 starting with an O in the middle and Random plays as p2 with an X in the NW corner. 

You should use fair matches if you want to rule out lucky openings as a cause of strong performance. So to answer “is minimax better than Monte Carlo tree search?” use fair matches. To answer “is an opening book better than random openings?” you should *not* use fair matches.
