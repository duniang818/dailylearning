在成长的过程中，你是否曾意识到过自己的某种与众不同？又或者是你曾渴望过获得某种与众不同？本次文章摘自 R.J. Palacio 的小说 Wonder，讲述了一个因天生面部缺陷而造成自己“与众不同”的小男孩——奥吉的成长故事。每个人的成长都会经历或多或少的挫折，而家人，永远都是那个会在你身后给予支持和力量的角色。
I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. I mean, sure, I do ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have an Xbox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary. I guess. And I feel ordinary. Inside. But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don't get stared at wherever they go. 

我知道自己不是一个普通的十岁小孩。我是说，当然了，我做的也是普通的事情。我吃冰淇淋，骑自行车，打球，我还有一款XBox。这些东西让我貌似很普通，应该是吧。我感觉自己内心也挺普通的。不过我知道，一个普通的孩子不会在操场上吓得别的普通孩子失声尖叫，四散逃开。我知道，一个普通的孩子无论去哪里，都不会被人一路盯着看。

If I found a magical lamp and I could have one wish, I would wish that I had a normal face that no one ever noticed at all. I would wish that I could walk down the street without people seeing me and then doing that look-away thing. Here is what I think: the only reason I'm not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way. 

如果我得到一盏神灯，可以许一个愿望，我希望自己有一张压根没人会注意的普通脸。我希望在街上溜达的时候不会被人们留意到，接着又看着他们扭过脸去。我是这么想的：我不普通的唯一原因，是根本没有人这么认为。

But I'm kind of used to how I look by now. I know how to pretend I don't see the faces people make. We've all gotten pretty good at that sort of thing: me, Mom and Dad, Via. Actually, I take that back: Via's not so good at it. She can get really annoyed when people do something rude. Like, for instance, one time in the playground some older kids made some noises. I don't even know what the noises were exactly because I didn't hear them myself, but Via heard and she just started yelling at kinds. That's the way she is. I'm not that way.

不过，现在我也算是习惯自己的样子了。我知道怎么假装对人们挤眉弄眼视而不见。我们在这方面都很擅长：我，我妈，我爸，还有维娅。其实，我该收回这句话：维娅这方面并不擅长。当有人行为粗鲁，她会觉得很不爽。比如，有一次几个小孩子在操场上吵闹，我甚至都不知道噪音到底是什么，因为我自己根本听不到。但维娅听到后就朝这群孩子怒吼。她就是这样的。而我不并不是那样的人。

Via doesn't see me as ordinary. She says she does, but if I were ordinary, she wouldn't feel like she needs to protect me as much. And mom and dad don't see me as ordinary, either. They see me as extraordinary. I think the only person in the world who realizes how ordinary I am is me.

维娅不把我当普通人看。她虽然嘴上这么说，但如果我很普通的话，她就不会感觉那么需要保护我了。我爸妈也不把我当普通人看。他们觉得我很与众不同。唯独觉得我很普通的人就是我自己。

My name is August, by the way. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse. 

顺便提一句，我叫奥古斯特。我就不描述我的长相了。不管你是怎么想象的，情况都糟糕一倍。

Next week I start fifth grade. Since I've never been to a real school before, I am pretty much totally and completely petrified. People think I haven't gone to school because of the way I look, but it's not that. It's because of all the surgeries I've had. Twenty-seven since I was born. The bigger ones happened before I was even four years old, so I don't remember those. But I've had two or three surgeries every year since then (some big, and some small), and because I'm little for my age, and I have some other medical mysteries that doctors never really figured out, I used to get sick a lot. That's why my parents decided it was better if I didn't go to school. I'm much stronger now, though. The last surgery I had was eight months ago, and I probably won't have to have any more for another couple of years. 

下周我开始上五年级。因为从来没有真正上过学，所以我整个人都提心吊胆的。大家以为我不上学是因为我的长相，其实不是。真实原因是我做过的所有那些手术，从出生到现在有27次了。大手术都是在四岁以前做的，所以我都记不得了。但从那以后我每年都要动两三次手术（大的小的都有），因为我长得比实际年龄矮小，身上还带着一些医生永远理解不了的医学奥秘，所以我总是在生病。这也是父母决定我最好不去上学的原因。好在，现在我壮实多了。我上一次动手术是在八个月前，而且很可能未来几年内都不需要再动手术了。

Mom homeschools me. She used to be a children's-book illustrator. She draws really great fairies and mermaids. Her boy stuff isn't so hot, though. She once tried to draw me a Darth Vader, but it ended up looking like some weird mushroom-shaped robot. I haven't seen her draw anything in a long time. I think she's too busy taking care of me and Via.

妈妈在家教我。她以前是童书插画家，她的仙女和美人鱼画得好极了。不过，男孩子的东西她就画不好了。有一次，她试着给我画了一张黑武士，结果看起来像一个奇怪的蘑菇形状的机器人。我已经很久没有看到她画什么了。我想，照顾我和维娅就够她忙的了。

I can't say I always wanted to go to school because that wouldn't be exactly true. What I wanted was to go to school, but only if I could be like every other kid going to school. Have lots of friends and hang out after school and stuff like that.

我不能说自己一直都想去上学，事情不全是这样。我也想上学，前提是我能够跟别的那些上学的孩子一样，有很多的朋友啊，放学后一起闲逛啊，等等之类的。

Last spring we drove over to Christopher's house in Bridgeport. It was a long drive home. I fell asleep in the backseat like I always do. Via fell asleep, too. I don't know how long I was sleeping, but when I woke up, there was a full moon outside the car window. It was a purple night, and we were driving on a highway full of cars. And then I heard Mom and Dad talking about me. 

去年春天我们开车去克里斯托弗在布里奇波特的家，回家要开很久的车。我像往常一样在后座睡着了，维娅也睡了。我不知道睡了多久，醒来的时候，车窗外悬着一轮满月。那个夜晚是紫色的，我们行驶在一条车水马龙的公路上。这时，我听到妈妈和爸爸正在谈论我。

"We can't keep protecting him," Mom whispered to Dad, who was driving. 

“我们不能一直保护他，”妈妈低声跟正在开车的爸爸说。

"We can't just pretend he' s going to wake up tomorrow and this isn't going to be his reality, because it is, Nate, and we have to help him learn to deal with it. We can't just keep avoiding situations that..." 

“我们不能只是假装他明天会醒过来，这不是他的现实，事情就是这样的，内特，我们要帮着他学会处理问题，而不是一味逃避那些情况……”

"So sending him off to middle school like a lamb to the slaughter ...," Dad answered angrily, but he didn't even finish his sentence because he saw me in the mirror looking up.

“那就把送他去中学，就像待宰的羔羊那样……”爸爸生气地说，但是他话没说完就打住了，因为他从后视镜里看到我正抬头张望。

"I don't want to go to school," I answered, folding my arms.

“我不想去上学。”我抱着胳膊回答。

"It would be good for you, Auggie," said Mom.

“上学对你有好处，奥吉。”妈妈说。

"Maybe I'll go next year," I answered, looking out the window.

“也许明年我会去。”我看着窗外回答。

"This year would be better, Auggie," said Mom. "You know why? Because you'll be going into fifth grade, and that's the first year of middle school—for everyone. You won't be the only new kid."

“今年更好的，奥吉，”妈妈说。“你知道为什么吗？因为你要上五年级，也就是初中的第一年——所有学生都是第一年。这样你就不会是唯一的新生了。”

"I'll be the only kid who looks like me," I said.

“可长成我这样的小孩只有我一个。”我说。

"I'm not going to say it won't be a big challenge for you, because you know better than that," she answered. "But it'll be good for you, Auggie. You'll make lots of friends. And you'll learn things you'd never learn with me."  She turned in her seat again and looked at me.  

“我不否认这对你来说是个巨大的挑战，你懂我意思的，”她回答道。“但上学对你有好处，奥吉。你会交很多朋友。你也能学到很多从我这里永远学不到的东西。”她又从座椅上转了过来，看着我。

"I don't want to go," I said.

“我不想去。”我说。

"How about this? Can you at least meet Mr. Tushman before making up your mind?" Mom asked.

“这样好不好，在你做决定之前至少见一下图什曼先生？”妈妈问。

"Mr. Tushman?" I said.

“图什曼先生？”我说。 

"He's the principal," answered Mom.

“他是校长。”妈妈回答道。

"Mr. Tushman?" I repeated.

“图什曼先生？”我又问。

"I know, right?" Dad answered, smiling and looking at me in the rearview mirror. "Can you believe that name, Auggie? I mean, who on earth would ever agree to have a name like Mr. Tushman?" I smiled even though I didn't want to let them see me smile. Dad was the one person in the world who could make me laugh no matter how much I didn't want to laugh. Dad always made everyone laugh.

“就是说呢，对吧？”爸爸一边回答，一边从后视镜里看着我笑。“你敢相信有这种名字吗，奥吉？我是说，天底下谁会取名叫图什曼先生呢？”尽管我很不想让他们看到我笑，我还是笑了。在这个世界上，爸爸就是能让我开怀大笑的那个人，而且不管我情绪是多么低落。爸爸总是能让每个人开怀大笑。

"Auggie, you know, you should go to that school just so you can hear his name said over the loudspeaker!" Dad said excitedly. "Can you imagine how funny that would be? Hello, hello? Paging Mr. Tushman!" He was using a fake high, old-lady voice, "Hi, Mr. Tushman! I see you're running a little behind today! Did your car get rear-ended again? What a bum rap!"   

“你知道吗，奥吉，你应该去一下那所学校，这样你就能听到他的名字在喇叭中响起了！”爸爸兴奋地说。“你能想象那会有多搞笑吗？喂，喂？呼叫图什曼先生！”他装成一个老妇人，尖着嗓门高声说：“喂，图什曼先生！我看你今天迟到了！你的车又追尾了吗？真冤啊！”

I started laughing, not even because I thought he was being that funny but because I wasn't in the mood to stay mad anymore.

我笑了起来，不是因为觉得有多好笑，而是因为我没有心情再生气了。

"It could be worse, though!" Dad continued in his normal voice. "Mommy and I had a professor in college called Miss Butt." 

“不过，还有更糟的呢！”爸爸继续用正常的声音说，“你妈和我上大学的时候有个教授叫巴特小姐。”

Mom was laughing now, too.

这时妈妈也笑了起来。

"Is that for real?" I said.

“真的假的？”我问。

"Roberta Butt," Mom answered, raising her hand as if to swear. "Bobbie Butt." 

“大名 ‘罗伯塔•巴特’，”妈妈举起手回答，像是在发誓，“我们都叫她 ‘博比•巴特’。”

"She had huge cheeks," said Dad.

“她屁股很大。”爸爸说。

"Nate!" said Mom.

“内特！”妈妈叫道。

"What? She had big cheeks is all I'm saying." 

“怎么了？我只不过说她屁股大。”

Mom laughed and shook her head at the same time.

妈妈一边大笑，一边摇头。

"Hey hey, I know!" said Dad excitedly. "Let's fix them up on a blind date! Can you imagine? Miss Butt, meet Mr. Tushman. Mr. Tushman, here's Miss Butt. They could get married and have a bunch of little Tushies." 

“嘿嘿，我想起来了！”爸爸激动地说，“我们撮合他们相亲吧！你们能想象吗？巴特小姐，这位是图什曼先生；图什曼先生，这是巴特小姐。他们可能会结婚，然后生一堆小图什。”

"Poor Mr. Tushman," answered Mom, shaking her head. "Auggie hasn't even met the man yet, Nate!"

“可怜的图什曼先生，”妈妈摇头回答，“内特，奥吉都还没见过这个人呢！”

"Who's Mr. Tushman?" Via said groggily. She had just woken up.

“谁是图什曼先生？”维娅恍恍惚惚地问。她刚刚睡醒。

"He's the principal of my new school," I answered.

“他是我新学校的校长。”我回答道。

▍结尾曲

We're Going To Be Friends
演唱者：The White Stripes

Fall is here hear the yell
Back to school ring the bell
Brand new shoes walking blues
Climb the fence books and pens
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
I can tell that we are gonna be friends

秋天来到，呼声喧闹
铃声响起，是时候回学校
穿着新鞋，感觉像在走蓝调
带着书本和钢笔，翻过篱笆再走
我相信，我们一定会成为好朋友
我相信，我们一定会成为好朋友
......
